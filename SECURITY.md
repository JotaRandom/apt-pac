# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

Since this is a fun experiment project, standard disclaimer:
**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** This tool wraps `pacman` and `makepkg` often with elevated privileges (`sudo`).
While we try to be safe, bugs could theoretically damage your system.

If you find a security hole, please open a GitHub Issue with the "Security" label (if available) or email the maintainers directly.
